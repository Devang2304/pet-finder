# PET FINDER üê∂üêï

The main moto of developing this webapp is to help street dogs & cats get adopted.
The website have integrated google map in it where whenever user opens our app. The location of street pets available within the range is displayed with their images so that those who want to adopt street can adopt these pets from the given locations.
I have created a _*REST API*_ for fetching location and image data of the pet available within the range set by the user. User can also perform search operation for getting the locations of pets present in other areas.By default the street pets locations are displayed according to the user's current location.
